"""
This sub package provides logging mechanism for the plugin development.

Blender is not easy to debug (adding an external debugger is planned) such that providing informative
output to a log file is mandatory.
The log file is stored in the path stored in the plugin directory (:data:`.config.script_path`) in
``resources/log.txt``.

An example of a log file:


.. literalinclude:: ../../../doc/source/developer_manual/log_example.txt

Logging of operators can be automated with the decorators and base classes in the :mod:`.operators` module.
