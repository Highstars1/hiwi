    Base Class for conditions.

    Classes should implement a ``check()`` method which returns a tuple of (bool,str) stating whether
    the condition's are met and an (potentially) empty error message.

    Using the :meth:`.operators.RDOperator.Preconditions` decorator, the conditions that should be met
    when executing an operator (i.e., a subclass of :class:`.operators.RDOperator`) are added to the classes'
    list of preconditions and :meth:`check_conditions` is called when Blender executes the
    :meth:`.operators.RDOperator.poll` method.

    .. note::

        Instances of this type should never be created.

    For examples see :class:`robot_designer_plugin.operators.helpers.ModelSelected`.
